#+title: README for PYTHIA+HYDJET at sqrt(s) = 5360 GeV MC production

* Instructions

- ~LXPLUS 8~
- ~CMSSW_14_0_0~

Open an apptainer environment

#+begin_src sh
  cmssw-el8
#+end_src

Do the following command to set the correct architecture

#+begin_src sh
  export SCRAM_ARCH=el8_amd64_gcc10
  cmsrel CMSSW_14_0_0 # if you haven't created the CMSSW yet
  cd CMSSW_14_0_0/src
  cmsenv
#+end_src

Clone the ~MC_production~ git repo:

#+begin_src sh
  # execute from src
  git clone git@github.com:claytoniousfunk/MC_production.git  
#+end_src

Make a ~GenProductions~ folder and copy the gen fragment in:

#+begin_src sh
  # execute following commands from src
  mkdir -p Configuration/GenProduction/python/
  cp MC_production/PbPb_MC/PYTHIA8_HYDJET_DiJet_5360GeV/PYTHIA8_HYDJET_DiJet_5360GeV_genFragment.py Configuration/GenProduction/python/
#+end_src

Build the environment
#+begin_src sh
  export SCRAM_ARCH=el8_amd64_gcc10
  scram b -j 8
#+end_src
