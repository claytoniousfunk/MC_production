* Summary
These scripts are used to generate PYTHIA8 DiJet MC samples.  The steps are
- GEN-SIM
- RAW
- RECO

The gen fragement must be put in ~CMSSW_14_0_0/src/Configuration/GenProduction/python/~.  The path is specified in the ~GEN-SIM.sh~ script.

Note that the scripts have the ~--no-exec~ option enabled, meaning that the config will be created but not run.  To run the config, do the command

#+begin_src sh
  cmsRun -e -j log.xml config_stepX.py
#+end_src

where ~config_stepX.sh~ is the GEN, RAW, or RECO python config output from the corresponding scripts.
